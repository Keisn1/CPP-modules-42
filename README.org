#+title: CPP Module 00

* General Rules
- compile with
  #+begin_src shell
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98
  #+end_src
- exercises in the form
  - /ex00; /ex01
- name files, classes, function, member functions and attirbutes as required
- class name in *UpperCamelCase*
  - files containing class code will always be named according to the class name
    - *ClassName.hpp*
    - *ClassName.h*
    - *ClassName.cpp*
    - *ClassName.tpp*

- unless specified differently, every output needs to be followed by a newline and to Standard output
- no coding style enforced on the CPP-modules
- allowed to use almost everything from the standard library
  - use as much as possible from new libraries
** forbidden
- no usage of any other external library
  - *C++11* libraries are forbidden
  - *printf
  - *allow
  - *free
- no
  #+begin_src cpp
using namespace <ns_name>
friend
  #+end_src
- no containers (vector/list/map)
- no Algorithms
- STL allowed in 08 and 09 *only*
** orthodox canonical form
- from module 02 to 09, classes need to be designed in th *orthodox canonical form* (except when explicitely stated otherwise)
** header files
- no function implementations inside header files
- should be able to use independently form each other
  - need to include everything they need
  - avoid double inclusion (*include guards*)
** additional files
- additional files possible
- but need to turn in mandatory files
** advice
- read each module completely before starting
