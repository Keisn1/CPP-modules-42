#+begin_src c
int i { 48 };
char ch = i; // implicit narrowing conversion
#+end_src
- problematic since we don't know if the integer fits into a char (might be overflowing)
- potentially unsafe
- compiler will typically print a warning

#+begin_src c
int i { 48 };

// explicit conversion from int to char, so that a char is assigned to variable ch
char ch { static_cast<char>(i) };
#+end_src
- conversion is intended
  - we accept responsibility for the consequences
