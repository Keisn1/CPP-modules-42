#+title: raw string literals
#+date: [2025-02-17 Mon 07:40]
#+startup: overview

ATTENTION: This is messy, ask LLM or refer to the book (it is so awkward)

#+begin_src cpp
string s = R"(\w\\w)"; // Iâ€™m pretty sure I got that right
#+end_src

- initial R is there to distinguish raw from ordinary string literals
- paranthesis are there to allow ("unescapted") double quotes
  #+begin_src cpp
R"("quoted string")"
  #+end_src
