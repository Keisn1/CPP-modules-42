#+title: static data members

#+startup: overview

- Static data members are shared among all instances of the class
- There's only one copy of a static data member, regardless of the number of objects created
- They are used for storing values common to all objects and are often used for class-wide settings or counters
- Static data members must be defined outside the class, typically in a source file, without the =static= keyword
- They can be accessed using the class name and scope resolution operator (e.g., =ClassName::member=) or through an object
