- derived classes in CPP are Classes that are declared with following syntax
  - in this case we are using [[id:70a9181a-27f9-46c2-8f9a-0df0389de3a0][public inheritance]]
- when deriving a class, the derived class *contains* the instance of the base-class
  - it includes the base-class as a subobject
#+begin_src cpp
class Derived : public Base{
	...
}
#+end_src
