#+title: destruction of derived classes
#+date: [2025-03-25 Tue 11:10]
#+startup: overview

- in case of destruction, the derived class needs to be deleted first
- it is done in this order, because
  1. the derived class can be sure that the inherited-members and the base class still exist
  2. avoids that already destroyed ressources are accessed by the derived class
  3. Each class is responsible for its ressources
