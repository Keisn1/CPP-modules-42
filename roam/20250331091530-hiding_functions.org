Hiding functions in CPP lingo, actually means, that a function of a base-class is implemented with the same name but different signature in a derived class.
When the function has the same signature, it is considered [[id:d0f79033-59d4-4626-b5f8-1662e49ddc8c][overidden]].

In the case of overriding, it is also hidden. But these terms are quite seperately used. The hidden term is used when the described case above arises.

#+begin_src cpp
#include <iostream>
class Base {
	public:
	void print() { std::cout << "hello from base" << std::endl; }
};

class Der: public Base {
	public:
	void print(int i) { std::cout << "hello from derived" << i << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Der der;
	der.print(1);

	Base* b = &der;
	b->print();
    return 0;
}
