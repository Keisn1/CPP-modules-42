#+title: method resolution

#+startup: overview

- method resolution appears when there are multiple candidate class methods to be called, particularly in the context of inheritance
- specifically when a method is overriden

- the method resolution order (MRO) of the given language is determining the method that is being called
- inside a class hierarchy, the derived class will always use the most recent overriden version of a method
- in CPP, when using multiple inheritance, and there is a method of the base class that is overridden by multiple parents at the same level, this will lead to an ambiguity error thrown by the compiler (in CPP)

 This behavior is due to dynamic dispatch (or late binding), which ensures that the method corresponding to the actual object's class is invoked at runtime.
