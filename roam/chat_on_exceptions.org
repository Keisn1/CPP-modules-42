*** In cpp, when i have class with a private data member which is constanct, how can i possibly write a copy assignment constructor for this class?

When you have a class with a private constant data member, you can't modify that constant after initialization, which poses a challenge for implementing a copy assignment operator. There are a few approaches to handle this:

1. *Delete the copy assignment operator*:
   #+begin_src cpp
   class MyClass {
   private:
      const int myConstant;
   public:
      MyClass(int val) : myConstant(val) {}
      MyClass& operator=(const MyClass&) = delete; // Explicitly forbid assignment
   };
   #+end_src

2. *Make a non-modifying copy assignment operator*:
   #+begin_src cpp
   class MyClass {
   private:
      const int myConstant;
   public:
      MyClass(int val) : myConstant(val) {}
      MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
          // Only copy non-const members
          // Check if constants are compatible
          if (myConstant != other.myConstant) {
              throw std::runtime_error("Cannot assign objects with different constant values");
          }
          return *this;
      }
   };
   #+end_src

3. *Use a proxy pattern or placement new*:
   #+begin_src cpp
   class MyClass {
   private:
      const int myConstant;
   public:
      MyClass(int val) : myConstant(val) {}
      MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
          if (this != &other) {
              this->~MyClass(); // Destroy current object
              new (this) MyClass(other); // Placement new to reconstruct
          }
          return *this;
      }
   };
   #+end_src

The third approach is dangerous and generally not recommended as it can lead to undefined behavior, especially with inheritance or when other resources are managed.

In most cases, the best practice is to either delete the copy assignment operator or make your class design compatible with immutability.

*** how do i define exception in cpp98?

In C++98, defining exceptions is straightforward since the standard library already provides a base =std::exception= class. Here's how to define custom exceptions in C++98:

*** Basic Exception Definition

#+begin_src cpp
#include <exception>
#include <string>

class MyException : public std::exception {
private:
    std::string message;

public:
    // Constructor
    MyException(const std::string& msg) : message(msg) {}

    // Destructor must be virtual for inheritance
    virtual ~MyException() throw() {}

    // Override what() method from std::exception
    virtual const char* what() const throw() {
        return message.c_str();
    }
};
#+end_src

*** Usage Example

#+begin_src cpp
void functionThatThrows() {
    throw MyException("Something went wrong");
}

int main() {
    try {
        functionThatThrows();
    } catch (const MyException&

*** what does throw() mean in thes definitions?

In C++98, the =throw()= specification in function declarations is called an "exception specification." When you see:

#+begin_src cpp
virtual const char* what() const throw()
#+end_src

The =throw()= at the end means that the function promises not to throw any exceptions. It's equivalent to saying "this function won't throw exceptions of any type."

This was C++98's way of specifying exception guarantees. A few key points:

1. =throw()= means the function won't throw any exceptions
2. =throw(ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2)= would mean the function might throw only those specific exception types
3. No specification means the function could throw any exception

In modern C++ (C++11 and later), this syntax was deprecated and replaced with =noexcept= because the exception specifications were found to be problematic. But in C++98, =throw()= was the standard way to indicate that a function wouldn't throw exceptions.

For example, the destructor and =what()= function are typically marked with =throw()= to guarantee they won't throw during stack unwinding when exceptions are already being processed.

*** what about the throw keyword in functionThatThrows?

The =throw= keyword in the =functionThatThrows()= example has a completely different purpose from the =throw()= exception specification.

When used on its own like this:

#+begin_src cpp
void functionThatThrows() {
    throw MyException("Something went wrong");
}
#+end_src

The =throw= keyword is used to actually throw (raise) an exception. It creates an exception object and transfers control to the nearest matching catch handler in the call stack.

To summarize the difference:

1. =throw ExceptionObject= - Actively throws an exception, interrupting normal program flow
2. =throw()= after a function declaration - A specification that promises the function won't throw any exceptions

So in the example:
- =throw MyException("Something went wrong")= creates and throws an exception object
- =virtual const char* what() const throw()= declares that the =what()= function won't throw any exceptions itself

These are two distinct uses of the same keyword in C++98.

*** how do i define an exception inside a class?

To define an exception inside a class in C++98, you create a nested class that inherits from =std::exception=. Here's how to do it:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <exception>
#include <string>

class MyClass {
public:
    // Define exception inside the class
    class Exception : public std::exception {
    private:
        std::string message;

    public:
        Exception(const std::string& msg) : message(msg) {}
        virtual ~Exception() throw() {}

        virtual const char* what() const throw() {
            return message.c_str();
        }
    };

    void doSomething() {
        // Method that might throw the nested exception
        if (/* error condition */) {
            throw Exception("Error in MyClass::doSomething()");
        }
    }
};

// Using the exception:
int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    try {
        obj.doSomething();
    } catch (const MyClass::Exception& e) {
        // Handle the exception
        std::cout << "Caught exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
#+end_src

The nested exception is accessed using the scope resolution operator (=MyClass::Exception=). This approach encapsulates the exception within the class namespace, making it clear which component is generating the exception.

*** how does the insertion operator works in cpp?

* Insertion Operator in C++

The insertion operator (=<<=) in C++ is used primarily for output streams. Here's how it works:

** Basic Understanding

The insertion operator is actually an overloaded operator that sends data to an output stream:

#+begin_src cpp
std::cout << "Hello, world!";
#+end_src

This is syntactic sugar for:

#+begin_src cpp
std::cout.operator<<("Hello, world!");
#+end_src

** How it Works Internally

1. The =<<= operator is defined in the =std::ostream= class for basic types
2. It returns a reference to the stream, enabling chaining:
   #+begin_src cpp
   std::cout << "Value: " << 42 << std::endl;
   #+end_src

3. The signature for standard types looks like:
   #+begin_src cpp
   ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const T& value);
   #+end_src

** Creating Your Own Insertion Operator

For custom classes, you can overload the =<<= operator:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <iostream>

class Person {
private:
    std::string name;
    int age;

public:
    Person(std::string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Person& p);
};

// Insertion operator defined as a friend function
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Person& p) {
    os << "Person: " << p.name << ", Age: " << p.age;
    return os;
}

int main() {
    Person john("John", 30);
    std::cout << john << std::endl; // Uses our custom operator
    return 0;
}
#+end_src

** Key Points

1. Always return a reference to the stream to enable chaining
2. Implement as a friend function or a free function (not a member function)
3. Make the second parameter a const reference to avoid unnecessary copying
4. Add only formatting that's appropriate for all potential output streams

The insertion operator works with other streams too, like file streams and string streams, not just =std::cout=.

*** is friend part of cpp98?


Yes, the =friend= keyword is part of the original C++ standard and was definitely included in C++98. It's not a newer feature that was added in later standards.

In C++98, you could use =friend= declarations to:

1. Grant a function access to private and protected members of a class
2. Grant another class access to private and protected members of a class

The syntax is the same as in modern C++:

#+begin_src cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int privateData;

public:
    MyClass(int data) : privateData(data) {}

    // Friend function declaration
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const MyClass& obj);

    // Friend class declaration
    friend class FriendClass;
};

// Definition of the friend function
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const MyClass& obj) {
    // Can access privateData directly
    os << "MyClass with data: " << obj.privateData;
    return os;
}
#+end_src

Friend declarations were and still are commonly used for operator overloading, particularly for operators that should not be member functions (like the insertion operator), as they were in C++98.
